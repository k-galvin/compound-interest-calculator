| • Correct computation | Compound interest is computed correctly | 15/15 |

| **Baseline design/layout** | | |
| • Responsiveness | Good | 20/20 |
| • Site balance and aesthetics | Very good, great color theme | 15/15 |
| **Implementation specifications** | | |

| • Flex layout | Meets criteria with `input-area` | ✅ |
| • Title | Title meets criteria | ✅ |

| • Input other than text | Meets criteria with dropdown | ✅ |
| • Margin | Margin meets criteria | ✅ |
| • Padding | Padding meets criteria | ✅ |
